Luxury Coupons Web

# Welcome to my Luxury coupons project! Client side :+1:
I've built it with 2 other junior programmers as a final project for our course.

What is the goal of the project?
--------------------------------
to reflect our skills in the client side! :)
We worked hard on every little bug and I learned A LOT of new things in the process (and it never stops).

How is the front end built?
--------------------------------
we used create-react-app with Ts template for our client side with redux, and a web template for the main design.

how to find what?
--------------------------------
the main data is in the src->Components->Menu->MainArea, the client side like the server side is divided by the controllers,
Admin -> All the Admin actions
Company -> All the company actions
Customer -> All the customer actions
Guest -> this is the default, as for this project the guest can only register.

How about the design?
--------------------------------
The design is mainly CSS, and the rest is a Template.

Are there any cool features?
--------------------------------
some cool features in my opinion:
A. react-persist -> now each time that we reload the page (hard refresh) the data will be saved and you can continue exactly where you left off! (even if you close the browser!)
B. we decided to add Images to all the coupons and make the website a bit more colorful :)

In conclusion:
--------------------------------
I focused on the base a lot more than we tried to implement a new cool features,
After all, this website is here to demonstrate my skills and passion for the field.

Hope you Enjoyed it! ðŸ˜ƒ
